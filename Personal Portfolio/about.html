        Hello, I am Brisk. I am currently just taking my time learning to code
        and will see where it could possibly take me down the road. <br />
        Outside of web dev some of my hobbies include Video Games, Photography,
        and collecting Trading Cards. <br />I would say my skillset thus far
        only includes HTML,CSS and a little bit of JS but I will continute
        adding to it daily.
